About sgGWR
=================================
Welcome to **sgGWR**! sgGWR (Stochastic Gradient approach for Geographically Weighted Regression) is scalable bandwidth calibration software for GWR.

Installation
=================================

We recommend installing JAX (https://github.com/google/jax) package for efficient computation.
To install sgGWR with JAX, please execute the following on your terminal.

.. code-block ::

   pip install sgGWR[jax]

If you cannot install JAX (e.g., Windows users), you can omit `[jax]` option.


.. code-block ::

   pip install sgGWR
